<summary><strong>Dyemaking Table</strong></summary>

The **Dyemaking Table** is a new crafting station used to create **Bottled Dye**, an item that allows you to dye clothing in advanced and unique ways.

A **Dye Core** is used to define the dye’s behavior. Different dye types can drastically change how colors are displayed or animated on dyed items.

### Dye Types

| Dye type | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Default** | Basic dye that displays a single static color. |
| **Rainbow** | Cycles through all rainbow colors, changing every tick. |
| **Polychromatic** | Displays the base color while applying a shader that shifts hue depending on the viewing angle. |
| **Ender** | Renders with an end-portal-like parallax effect. |
| **Sculk** | Uses the base color as the main color and the secondary color as a pulse, triggering whenever nearby sounds occur. |
| **Biome** | Automatically uses the grass color of the current biome. |
| **Glowstone** | Displays the base color at full brightness, creating a glow-in-the-dark effect when used with dynamic lighting mods. |
| **Redstone** | Displays red color. Redstone can be added to the dye core up to 15 times to increase intensity. |
| **Lamp** | Combines Redstone and Glowstone behavior, emitting light based on the dye core’s redstone power level. |
| **Speed** | Color shifts based on player movement speed, using the primary and secondary colors. |
| **Height (Bedrock)** | Color transitions from the primary color at the lowest world height to the secondary color at the highest build limit. |
| **Height (Sea Level)** | Similar to Height (Bedrock), but calculated relative to sea level instead. |
| **Pride (16)** | Displays a pride flag pattern. These dyes do not use or store colors. |
